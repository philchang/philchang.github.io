\noindent A 10000 kg locomotive pulls a 20000 kg traincar down a level track.  (a) Draw a free-body diagram of the system. If the acceleration of the train is 0.1 m/s$^2$ (b) find the new force acting on the locomotive-traincar system, (c) the net force acting of the locomotive, (d) net force acting on the traincar.

\noindent A mass $m=8$ kg hangs from the ceiling supported by wires with tension $T_1$, $T_2$, and $T_3$.  If $\theta_1 = 45^o$ and $\theta_2=30^o$, find the tensions $T_1$, $T_2$, and $T_3$.\\
