\noindent A rocket's displacement is given by $\vec{r}(t) = (10 t \hat{x} + 2.0 t^2 \hat{y})$ m  as a function of time.  Find an expression for the (a) velocity and (b) acceleration of the rocket.  What is the displacement and velocity at $t=10$ seconds.
\newpage
\noindent An archer tries to hit a target that sits 10 m high on a castle wall that is 100 m away.  If the archer aims at 60 degrees above the horizon, what speed must the arrow leave to hit this target.
\newpage
\noindent An archer aims 30 degree above the horizon fires at a
charging knight that is 200m downrange and moving toward the archer
at 10 m/s.  How fast does the arrow have to leave the
archer in order to hit the knight?  At what position from the archer
does the arrow hit the knight?     
\newpage
\noindent A car moves along a circular track which has a radius of 30 m at a constant speed.  If the passengers feel an acceleration of 1 $m/s^2$ toward the center of the track, how fast is the car traveling?
