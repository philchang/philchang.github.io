\pagestyle{empty}
\noindent Suppose you have a particle that starts at $x=2$ m and oscillates around an equilibrium position of $x=0$ with a period of 1 sec.  What is the position as a function of $t$?
\newpage
\noindent A spring that hangs on its initial equilibrium position gets extended by 1 m after a 100 kg mass is hung on its end. What is the period of oscillation for this system if the mass is pulled down a little?
