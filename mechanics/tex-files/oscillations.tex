\pagestyle{empty}
\noindent Suppose you have a particle that starts at $x=2$ m and oscillates around an equilibrium position of $x=0$ with a period of 1 sec.  What is the position as a function of $t$?
\newpage
\noindent A spring that hangs on its initial equilibrium position gets extended by 1 m after a 100 kg mass is hung on its end. What is the period of oscillation for this system if the mass is pulled down a little? 
\newpage
\noindent Find the energy of the simple pendulum with mass m and length L exactly.  
\newpage
\noindent Suppose you have a spring system where you have a single mass, $m$, that has springs on both sides.  The left spring and right spring both have spring constant $k$.  Find the equation that governs the motion from newton's second law.  What is the solution? 
\newpage 
\noindent Show that $x(t) = A\sin(\omega t - k x)$ satisfies the wave equation, where $\omega$ and $k$ are some constants.  Find the relation between $\omega$, $k$, and $v$ so that the wave equation is satisfied.
\newpage
\noindent As you run toward a person, you emit a sound at a fixed frequency of 300 Hz. What frequency does the person hear??
