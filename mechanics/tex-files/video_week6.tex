\noindent A gun fires a shell straight up with a initially velocity of 1000 m/s.  How high does the shell reach above the gun?
\newpage
\noindent Suppose you have a mass of 80 kg and are riding a 10 kg bicycle up a steep mountain.  Ignoring friction forces and air resistance, it takes 
you 1 hour to climb a 2000 m mountain.  How much power do you have to generate to make this possible?
\newpage
\noindent Given a potential of the form $U = x^2 - x^3$, find the associated force and the equilibrium points.  State if these points are stable or unstable.
\newpage
\noindent Consider the pulley system below:  How much velocity does the 40 kg mass attain when it falls down 1 m and the 30 kg mass falls up 1 m.\\

\noindent Consider a rigid pendulum below where the pivot is frictionless and the rod is massless.  What the the velocity of the mass when it reaches the lowest point?\\
