\noindent A 100 kg box is on a level floor where the coefficient of static friction is $\mu_s = 0.8$.  What force must be exert horizontally to move the box? \\
\newpage
\noindent Consider the plane and pulley system below.   Find the minimum mass for which the more massive block starts sliding up the plane if the coefficient of static friction is $\mu_s = 1.0$.

\newpage
\noindent A car banks around a 30 degree turn with a 200 m radius. If the track is frictionless what speed should the car approach the turn?

\newpage
\noindent A student stirs a large coffee cup with radius 0.1 m at the rim.  The level of the liquid is 1 cm below the rim of the cup.  What speed does the student have the stir the cup to get the liquid to overflow the rim of the cup?
\newpage
\noindent A box is subject to a force the is defined as $F(x) = (10 x)$ N. How much work is done on the box if this force is applied on the box as it move 10 m in the direction of the force?
