\noindent A 0.1 m radius disk accelerates with an angular acceleration of $1$ rad/s$^2$.  Its initial angular velocity was $-20$ rad/s. (a) What is its angular velocity after 5 s (b) What are the tangential and radial components of the acceleration of a point on the disk? 
\newpage
\noindent Suppose you have a cylinder of radius 0.5 m and mass 1000 kg being spun on its outer rim of its length.  What is its moment of inertia? 
\newpage
\noindent In the diagram below $m_1=15$ kg, $m_2 = 20$ kg, $m_3=20$ kg, and $R=0.5$ m.  How fast is $m_2$ moving if it falls 1 m from its initial position?

\noindent Consider a hollow sphere rolling down an incline plane with a 45 degree angle to the horizon.  If the sphere has a mass of 0.1 kg and a radius of 0.1 m, what is the acceleration on the sphere if it rolls without slipping?
