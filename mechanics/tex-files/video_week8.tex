\begin{document}
\noindent A car with mass 2000 kg moving south at 5 m/s is struck by another car with mass 2500 kg moving east moving at 6 m/s.  What direction (angle from N) does the two car collision move in and at what speed? 
\newpage
\noindent A car with mass 2000 kg moving south by another car with mass 2500 kg moving east.  After they collide, the two car collision moves south east at an angle of 30 degrees from south at 5 m/s.  What was the initial speeds of the two cars?
\newpage
\noindent A 0.1 m radius disk accelerates with an angular acceleration of $1$ rad/s$^2$.  Its initial angular velocity was $-20$ rad/s. (a) What is its angular velocity after 5 s (b) What are the tangential and radial components of the acceleration of a point on the disk? 
\newpage
\noindent Suppose you have a cylinder of radius 0.5 m and mass 1000 kg being spun on its outer rim of its length.  What is its moment of inertia?
