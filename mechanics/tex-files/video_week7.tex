\noindent A spring with a spring constant of 1000 N/m is attached to a 10 kg mass and is stretched 0.5 m pass its equilibrium point.  If the coefficient of 
kinetic friction is 0.3, (a) what is the speed of the mass as the spring moves past is equilibrium point?  (b) how much work is done by the force of friction?
\newpage
%\noindent A child slides down a  slide that is 5 m above the ground.  What is the childs speed at ground level if the slide has a coefficient of friction of 0.1 and an incline of 45 degrees?

\noindent An 1 kg arrow is fired into and sticks in a 10 kg wooden block on a frictionless surface.  If the arrow and block are moving with a velocity of 2 m/s after they collide, what was the initial speed of the arrow?
\newpage
\noindent An 1 kg arrow is fired into and sticks in a 10 kg wooden block on a surface where the coefficient of kinetic friction is 0.4.  If the block and arrow move 10 m after the arrow strikes it, what was the initial velocity of the arrow?
