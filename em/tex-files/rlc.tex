\noindent Consider a ciruit with an ideal 60 Hz generator with peak voltage of 220 V connected to a 1 H inductor and a 1$\Omega$ resistor connected in series.  Find an expression for the current as a function of time.

\newpage

\noindent Consider a LC circuit consisting of a ac generator, an inductor with inductance L, and a capacitor with capacitance C connected in series.  What is the resonant frequency? If I swap out the inductor with an inductor whose inductance is $\eta$L, where $\eta$ is a arbitary factor, how does the resonant frequency change?

\newpage

\noindent Consider an ac generator with frequency, $f$, with peak voltage V, connected in series with a resistor (R), an inductor (L) and a capacitor (C).  What is the resonant frequency? What is the average power at this frequency? 

\newpage

\noindent Consider a circuit with a resistor (R), an inductor (L) and a capacitor (C) connected in series.  At t=0, a charge $Q_0$ is on the capacitor.  What is the charge Q as a function of time?
