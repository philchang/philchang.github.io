\noindent Consider a parallel plate capacitor that being charges with a current I.  (a) What is the displacement current as a function of time (b) Show the same thing by computing $d\phi_e/dt$
\newpage

\noindent Consider a cell tower which is 20m above the ground.  If you are 40 m away, what is the signal intensity if the tower transmits at 100 W.  How would it be different if you climb vertically up 20m from your spot. 
\newpage

\noindent Consider the wave equation $\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^2} = \frac 1 {v^2} \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial t^2}$.  Show that $\cos(x)\cos(vt)$ satisfies the wave equation.  Does any form of $f(x)f(vt)$ satisfy the wave equation? Why or why not?

\newpage

\noindent Consider 0.001 kg particles falling toward a mass M that has a cross sectional area of $10^{-4} $m$^2$.  (a) calculate the gravitational force at a distance r (b) if the mass has total power output in radiation of L, what is the radiation pressure at a distance r? (c) what is the radiation force on the particles (d) for what value of L does the radiation force equal the gravitational attraction. Show that this value of L is independent of r.
