\noindent Suppose you drop a rock from a height of 100 m.  How far does
  the rock travel in the last 3 seconds before it hits the ground?
\newpage
\noindent You drop a rock from a height h the same moment your friend
  throws a rock upward at speed v.  When the rocks collide, the
  falling rock has 4 times the instantaneous velocity of the upwardly
  moving thrown rock. What height, $h_{\rm collide}$, did the
  collision occur?
\newpage
\noindent A quarterback notices that the a defensive lineman is bearing
  down on him.  At t=0, the lineman has a position of x = -10 m,
  velocity of 10 m/s.  The quarterback needs to buy 1.5 second with his
  legs, if he starts accelerating at 5 m/s$^2$, can he buy this extra
  time?
\newpage
\noindent Suppose the position of a particle is given by $x(t) = 6 t^2 -
  10 t + 5$ m.  What is the instantaneous velocity?  What is the
  acceleration?
\newpage
\noindent Suppose I tell you that the acceleration of a particle is given
  by $a(t) = 4 t^3 - 6t^2$ m/s$^{2}$. (a) find its velocity as a
  function of time assume that at $t=0$, it had a velocity of $-6$ m/s
  (b) Find its position as a function of time if it starts out at x=0?
