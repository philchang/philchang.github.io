\noindent A helium nucleus in interstellar space has a mass of $6.4 \times 10^{-24}$ g and charge $1.6\times 10^{-19}$ C and sits in an uniform field of $10^{?8}$ T. What is its period of revolution around the magnetic field?
\newpage

\noindent A charged dust particle with mass $10^{-5}$ g and charge $1 $ nC, sits in a magnetic field with $B=10^{-9}$ T.  If the radius of the particle's orbit is $10^5$ km, what is the velocity of the particle?

\newpage

\noindent For a circular wire of radius R and current I has N turns, find the magnetic moment and the torque if
it symmetry axis makes an angle $\theta$ with the background uniform magnetic field. 

\newpage

\noindent Consider an uniformly charged spherel of radius R and total charge Q, rotating about
it symmetry axis with angular frequency, $\Omega$. What is the magnetic moment of this sphere?

\newpage

\noindent As per the previous problem, suppose this sphere has mass M and sits in a uniform magnetic field with strength B.  if the sphere's magnetic moment is displace a small angle from this field, what is its period of oscillation?
